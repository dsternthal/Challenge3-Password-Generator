# 03 JavaScript: Password Generator

## Your Task

The most challenging element of this was figuring out how to have the code generate a password the of the desired length.

I had to add an and (&&) parameter to each of the if statements in order to return a correct password length. Please see the screenshot below for the && statement I used.
